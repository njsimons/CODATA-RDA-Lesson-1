##**Module 1B. Anatomy of the DOI System**
---
The [DOI System](https://www.doi.org/) is the overall infrastructure by which Digital Object Identifiers are assigned, registered, resolved, and associated with valuable metadata including citation, availability of full text, funder information,  licensing information, and more. The following components of the DOI System together make it work.
* [The International DOI Federation (IDF)](http://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/7_IDF.html) is responsible for the overall governance of the system. IDF is a not-for-profit membership organization that oversees the operations of the federation of Registration Agencies which providing Digital Object Identifier (DOI) services and registration. IDF is also the registration authority for the ISO standard (ISO 26324) for the DOI system.
* [Registration Agencies](https://www.doi.org/registration_agencies.html) provide services to Registrants â€” allocating DOI name prefixes, registering DOI names and providing the necessary infrastructure to allow Registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data. Each RA must follow basic protocols and standards of the DOI sytem, including  a minimum metadata standard known as the DOI kernel. Yet each RA has the freedom to implement additional metadata standards, track a range of information about a given DOI resource, and offer public services for querying their databases.  As an example, the Registration Agency CrossRef registers a range of metadata about scholarly resources including funding data, license associated with the digital object, author data including ORCiD numbers, and more -- see April Ondis' CrossRef Blog posting [Beyond the DOI to richer metadata](http://blog.crossref.org/2016/06/beyond-the-doi-to-richer-metadata.html) for more info about their services.
* [Registrants](http://google.com) become members of a given Registration Agency in order to to register DOIs for information resources under their responsibility. Registrants include publishers, data centers, universities, libraries, university presses, and more. Registrants must follow the policies and procedures established by the RA in order to register DOIs. Each Registrant is given a unique code that forms the prefix of the DOI sequence. The Registrant then uses the suffix portion of the DOI sequence to assign unique names to each resource they manage.  For example, CODA serves as publisher for the Data Science Journal. CODATA DOIs for the articles inthis journal share the prefix 10.5334/.
